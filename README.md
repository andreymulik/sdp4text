# SDP for Text

SDP for Text is an implementation of the core SDP classes for Text.

## Reasons

Text is a good library that is used in many projects. I can’t call it ideal, but
Text representation has design advantages over Bytes and ByteList.

## Versioning

sdp4еуче follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and SDP wrapper
rules.
